# Analysis of popular attractions in Glasgow based on Tripadvisor data

One of Glasgow's most important sectors is tourism. And reviews of Glasgow's attractions on Tripadvisor, the world's largest travel site, can sway the opinions of many potential tourists. The analysis of TripAdvisor data is critical to the development of Glasgow's tourism.

The purpose of this research is to determine which of Glasgow's top popular attractions are listed on Tripadvisor. How are they ranked? What types of visitors do they draw in? What kind of feedback do visitors leave?

The research also looks at how the comments and ratings for each attraction have changed over time, identifies their peak seasons, uncovers variations in visitor ratings, and demonstrates the enormous influence of COVID's breakout.

Finally, this study aims to uncover attractions that have been ranked higher than their true impact as a result of commercial advertising, for reference by government agencies and tourists.
