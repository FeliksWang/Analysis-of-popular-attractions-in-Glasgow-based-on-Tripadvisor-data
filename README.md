# Analysis of popular attractions in Glasgow based on Tripadvisor data

Tourism is one of Glasgow's most important industries. And the comments of Glasgow's attractions on Tripadvisor, the world's largest travel platform, can influence the decisions of many potential visitors. Analysis of data from TripAdvisor is important to the development of Glasgow's tourism. 

The aim of this study is to find out which are the most important attractions in Glasgow on Tripadvisor? How popular they are? What kind of visitors do they attract? And what comments do they leave? 

Further, the study also explores the changes in the number of comments and ratings of each attraction over time, identify their hot seasons, find the changes in visitors' ratings and show the significant impact of the breakout of COVID. 

Finally, this research also attempts to unearth attractions that have been ranked higher than their actual impact due to commercial promotion, for reference by government departments and tourists.
